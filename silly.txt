bob smith, my assistant programmer, can always be found
hard at work in his cubicle. bob works independetly without
wasting company time talking to colleagues. bob never
thinks twice about assisting fellow employees, and he always
finishes given assignments on time. often bob takes extended
measures to complete his work, sometimes skipping coffee
breaks. bob is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no
vanity in spote of his high accomplishments and profound
knowledge in his field. i firmly believe that bob can be
classed as a high-caliber employee, the type which cannot be
dispensed with. consequently, i duly reccomend that bob be
promoted to executive managment, and a proposal will be
sent away as soon as possible.
